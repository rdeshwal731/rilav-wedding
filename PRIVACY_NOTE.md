This repository contains a **template** for a digital wedding invitation.

## 📝 Important Notes:

### For Users:
- This is a **public repository** - anyone can see the code
- **Personal details** (names, dates, venues) are in the actual `index.html` file
- You can customize all content by editing `index.html`
- Your **images** are stored in the `images/` folder (not tracked in git for privacy)

### What's Public:
- ✅ Template code and styling
- ✅ Documentation and setup guides
- ✅ Technical implementation

### What's Private (Your Deployment):
- 🔒 Your actual website URL
- 🔒 Your custom images
- 🔒 Your event details (once you customize)
- 🔒 Your Google Analytics data

## 🎨 Customization:

All personal information should be edited in:
1. `index.html` - Event details, names, dates, venue
2. `images/` folder - Your couple photos
3. `audio/` folder - Your music file (optional)

## 🚀 Deployment:

When you deploy to GitHub Pages or Netlify, your **live website** is separate from this code repository. Visitors see your beautiful invitation, not the code!
