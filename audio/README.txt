BACKGROUND MUSIC FOR WEDDING INVITATION
========================================

✅ MUSIC ALREADY CONFIGURED!

Current Setup:
--------------
The invitation is using a beautiful royalty-free romantic piano instrumental 
from an external URL. The music:
- Plays automatically when the card opens
- Loops continuously
- Is soft and romantic
- Works on all devices (mobile & desktop)

Adding Custom Music (Optional):
--------------------------------
If you want to use your own music file instead:

1. Add your music file to this folder
2. Name it exactly: background.mp3
3. The invitation will automatically use your local file

Recommendations for custom music:
- Format: MP3 (most compatible)
- Duration: 2-3 minutes (loops automatically)
- Quality: 128-192 kbps (balance quality and file size)
- Keep file size under 2MB for fast loading
- Pre-normalize volume (not too loud)

- Acoustic guitar instrumental
- Orchestral romantic piece

NOTES:
- External music is already working - no action needed
